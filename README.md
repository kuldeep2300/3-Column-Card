# Frontend Mentor - 3-Column Preview Card Component Solution

This is my solution to the [3-column preview card component challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/3column-preview-card-component-pH92eAR2-) on Frontend Mentor. The challenge was to create a responsive card component with three columns that looks as close as possible to the given design.

## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Media queries for responsiveness

### What I Learned

This project helped me deepen my understanding of responsive design and CSS layout techniques. Here are a few specific things I learned:

- How to use Flexbox to align and distribute elements within a container.
- Applying media queries to create mobile-friendly layouts.
- Styling hover states for buttons to improve interactivity.

Here is an example of CSS I used for the hover effect on buttons:

```css
.button {
  background-color: var(--primary-color);
  transition: background-color 0.3s;
}

.button:hover {
  background-color: var(--hover-color);
}
```

### Continued Development

I plan to focus more on:

- Enhancing animations for smoother transitions.
- Exploring CSS Grid to compare its effectiveness with Flexbox for similar layouts.
- Experimenting with CSS frameworks like Tailwind CSS to speed up styling.

### Useful Resources

- [CSS Tricks - Flexbox Guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - A comprehensive guide to Flexbox that helped me understand alignment and distribution properties.
- [MDN Web Docs - Media Queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries) - A great resource to learn how to make layouts responsive.
